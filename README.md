# Tampere-events
A legacy repo from 2017, this is a course project solo effort of events around Tampere area.

The gist is that this website retrieves events around tampere area and displays them on google maps. The project lives in a limbo now, since I focused mainly in the functionality of retrieving the events from the open API of city of Tampere, unfortunately it was not finished in the matter of the 5ECTS class, but it fulfilled the required functionality and more. There's a few nasty bugs to squash here and there.

Hae_tapahtuma.html is the main page and is the way to run it.
